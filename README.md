# CWTBootstrap5
This is the first Custom WordPress Theme that I create from scratch, on WP version 5.9 matching the frontend framework Twitter Bootstrap v5. It will be used on a site where I will collect leads from Facebook Ads, and maybe some SEO efforts in the future. I'm just building a portfolio as a developer, I never used Github because marketing automation was more in demand. Sure, I developed sites in the past, but aren't relevant to get an interview.

The site is Contratarunplan.com (for a small Ecuadorian audience), but please don't break it.

I'll stick to good practices but I won't explain the custom plugins I'll twist there. I'm a backend developer. If you surf my site you'll probably notice some frontend features that aren't available in this repository, I'm keeping some cool stuff for branding purposes. I started with basic files, made commits every now and then. 

This repository will be shared once's ready to be tested.

Contracts?
