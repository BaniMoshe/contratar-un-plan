# CWT-Bootstrap5
This is the first WordPress theme I create from scratch. It will be used on a site where I collect leads from Facebook Ads. 

The site is Contratarunplan.com (for a small LATAM audience)
But don't break it.

I'll stick to good practices, but I won't explain the plugins I'll twist when running the CMS. Is that acceptable?

I started with basic files, made commits every now and then. This repository will be shared once's ready to be tested.

Contracts?
